# To-Do List Dapp

This simple To-Do List Dapp uses Ganache as a private blockchain, Truffle for migrating the smart contracts and Lite-Server for running the app.

## Run the app

Start Ganache with `ganache`

Install the dependencies with `npm init`

Migrate your contracts with `truffle migrate --reset`

Start the app `npm run dev`

## Adding a task

To add a task, make sure you're logged in a Ganache's account with Metamask so you'll be able to pay for the fee.

## Warning

Make sure your npm and Node versions are compatible with the project (`9.6.1` for npm, `18.14.2` for Node).
